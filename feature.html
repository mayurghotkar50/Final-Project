    <h1>FEATURES  OF  CAR  RENTAL  SYSTEM  </h1>
    <h3>1.Facilitate automated check-in and checkout</h3>

Booking management is the most basic function of a car rental software. The application should be advanced enough so that the client can make online reservations instead of physically taking efforts.

From taking down the basic contact details of the customer to information like duration and destinations of the ride, time and date, negotiation of prices — the software must be able to handle all these operations in a fast, efficient and reliable manner.

<br>
<h3>2.Allow online cancellation</h3>

On one hand, while the software automates the booking process, it should also look into swift cancellation of rides, if the customer demands it.

It should also ensure that both the company as well as the customer are on the same page concerning the ride. It should also look into penalizing a consumer if there are repeated, unjust cancellations.

<br>

<h3>3.Should incorporate advanced search filters to ease the booking process</h3>

The search filters allow the renters to search according to their preferences at the fastest time possible.

The customers should have the option to filter their choices on parameters like type of car needed, self-drive, outstation or in-city tour, hours of booking among other details.

<br>
<h3>4.Should facilitate dynamic pricing; allow comparison</h3>

The car tracker should be able to list the rental prices under one table, making it easier for the customers to find their desired vehicle. It should also be able to adjust the rent according to demand, high season rates or promotional prices.

It should also allow them to compare one car against another. This gives the passengers room to make the choice, keeping in mind all the factors and costs involved.

<br>
<h3>5.Driving license, documents verifier and scanner</h3>

You wouldn’t want to get tangled in a legal mess because the client has probably forgotten his license during the ride or the document has expired. Digital scanning of the license and documents makes the entire process of renting a vehicle easy.

With the application, you can get a scanned copy of the license right at the time of registration and can store it in the database for future journeys of the passengers. Manually keeping a tab on the documents would be a cumbersome process.

<br>
<h3>6.Trace pending payments</h3>

Pre-rental charges sometimes do not cover all the expenses. It can be a tad difficult to settle the charges when the reservations and transactions are done online.

Modern applications, however, put you in the position of control as they give you an instant overview of the past reservations and transactions.

The software also acts as a storage for all the client data. Before striking a new deal, you can always check if there are any pending payments. They do not allow a new booking to take place until the backlogs of the payment are cleared.

<br>
<h3>7.Multi-language support</h3>

When you reach out to customers in a language that they are comfortable, greater are the chances for client satisfaction. Also more the languages the greater is your audience base.

Ensure that the software is compatible with at least a few of the languages that are more prevalent in the area. Basic information like car model, type, price range should be available in multiple languages.

<br>
<h3>8.Compatible with different currencies; integrates different payment modes</h3>

Most people who rent cars are travelers belonging to different countries. The company will be at an advantage if the software is compatible with different currencies. Do not let boundaries limit your business!

It’s important to remember that you are catering to a global market.

Additionally, the application should also support multiple payment modes like credit cards, debit cards, online channels, pay wallets among others.

It can also have basic card details so that all the customer needs to do is put in the password to complete the transaction.

<br>
<h3>9.Customer relationship management</h3>

Client satisfaction is undoubtedly the aim of having the software on-board the fleet. When a user request for rental service, they should get a fast response prompted with a specific time.

The same holds for a situation where they want to flag a complaint or share their bad experiences.

The software should have an in-built system where they can raise their issues, rate their experience.

It should also allow the customers to chat or talk to executives in case the need arises.

<br>
<h3>10.Location-based rentals</h3>

A good quality software will allow the bookings based on the location of the fleet. This will help you save resources, time as well as maintain the vehicle.
